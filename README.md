#Task 2
The next promotion campaign should be based on the results from previous data
As we can see the promotions are not being looked, hence not bringing new customers
It is also seen that the only old customers are interacting with promotions 
lastly the people with only good incomes are interacting with promotions

So the promotion team should do a deep analysis
And the promotion team should focus on the products that are bought in large amount that is wine
